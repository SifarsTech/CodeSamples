## Purpose

BlockEthServiceImplementation is a Java class that implements the `BlockEthService` interface. It is part of a Spring-based service that provides summaries of transactions for a given Ethereum address, grouped by blocks. This service utilizes MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

## Use Case

The primary use case of this code is to fetch and aggregate Ethereum transaction data based on specified criteria, such as an Ethereum address, starting and ending block numbers. The code achieves this by using MongoDB aggregation pipelines to process the data efficiently.

### Key Features

- Fetch transactions sent to or received from a specific Ethereum address.
- Filter transactions based on starting and ending block numbers.
- Aggregate transaction data to provide summaries by block, including the number of transactions sent and received, as well as the total value sent and received.
- The code is designed to be used as part of a larger Ethereum blockchain analysis or monitoring system.
