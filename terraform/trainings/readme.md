Linode
======
Periodically, we organize sessions to facilitate the exchange of ideas among our team members.
For sessions that involve time-consuming environment setups, we rely on Terraform to automate the provisioning of Linode instances.
Here we included the provisioning of Linode instances.
Ansible is utilized to dynamically configure the provisioned Linode instances based on the specific needs of the session.
Members who require access, can request credentials to these pre-configured machines.
Members can use these instances throughout the duration of the session, allowing them to focus on the session's objectives without worrying about environment setup.
