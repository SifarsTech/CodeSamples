## Purpose

The provided code is designed to serve as a backend service that handles document processing and information retrieval tasks. Its main purpose is to facilitate the retrieval of information from documents, store document embeddings, and provide responses to user queries based on the processed documents. Here's a breakdown of its primary components and purpose:

1. **Document Processing**: The code processes documents, specifically Excel files, and converts them into a format suitable for information retrieval. This includes reading Excel files, converting them to CSV, and storing document embeddings.

2. **Document Embeddings**: The code utilizes pre-trained word embeddings to represent documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings are stored for efficient retrieval.

3. **User Query Handling**: Users can submit queries to the system, and the code responds with relevant information from the processed documents.

## Use Case

The code can be used in a variety of applications where document-based information retrieval is required. Here are some potential use cases:

### 1. Knowledge Management System

Organizations can use this system to manage and search through their knowledge repositories, which may contain a vast amount of documents, reports, and data.

### 2. Customer Support Chatbot

A chatbot powered by this code can provide answers to user queries by searching through a knowledge base of documents. For example, a customer support chatbot can quickly retrieve relevant information from manuals or FAQs.

### 3. Data Analysis and Reporting

Data analysts can use this code to preprocess and analyze datasets stored in Excel files. The embeddings can be used for similarity-based retrieval of relevant data points.

### 4. Document Search Engine

The code can be integrated into a custom document search engine, enabling users to search through a collection of documents and retrieve specific information efficiently.

## Key Components

The code comprises several key components:

- **Document Processing**: Excel files are read, converted to CSV format, and stored. The code handles file operations and data transformation.

- **Document Embeddings**: Pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) are used to represent documents as vectors. These embeddings facilitate fast and efficient similarity-based retrieval.

- **User Query Handling**: Users can submit text queries, and the code leverages the embeddings to retrieve relevant information from the processed documents.

- **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error messages.

- **Environment Variables**: Environment variables, such as the OpenAI API key, are used for configuration. These variables should be set before running the code.
